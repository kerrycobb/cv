Our investigations support the recognition of four unique evolutionary lineages distributed across Luzon Island in the Philippines, three of which are herein described as new species (P. tikbalangi sp. nov., P. manananggalae sp. nov., and P. duwendorum sp. nov.). All four recognized species are genetically divergent in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, and morphologically distinct. The description of three new Luzon Island endemic species adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that mechanisms driving the accumulation of vertebrate diversity in the Philippines may vary regionally across the archipelago. {\textcopyright} 2014 Magnolia Press.},

abstract = {Aim: To highlight the significant conservation challenge of evaluating peripheral endemic vertebrates in island archipelago systems and to assess empirically the complexities of approaches to conservation genetic studies across political and biogeographic boundaries. To demonstrate the poignant need for international collaboration and coordination when species delimitation problems with high conservation concern involve island endemics with biogeographically peripheral ranges. Location: Southeast Asia, Lanyu Island, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Methods: Genetic samples were collected and sequenced for one mitochondrial gene and five nuclear loci for species of the Gekko mindorensis-G. kikuchii species complex in Southeast Asia. We used maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic methods and coalescent-based species delimitation analyses to estimate phylogeographic relationships, construct multilocus haplotype networks and test putative species boundaries. Results: Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses suggest that Kikuchi's Gecko may represent a peripheral population of a widespread species distributed from the northern Philippines to Taiwan. However, we identify a discrepancy between inferences of species boundaries resulting from methods based on allele frequencies versus coalescent-based methods that incorporate evolutionary history. Coalescent-based analyses suggest that G. kikuchii may be a distinct evolutionary lineage. Our study underscores the need for coalescent-based methods in conjunction with population genetic approaches for conservation genetic assessments of widespread species. Main conclusions: This study joins a few recent works suggesting that Philippine-derived anomalies in the fauna of Lanyu (and possibly greater Taiwan) are worthy of careful reconsideration. Determining whether each is the result of recent human-mediated introduction or (possibly more ancient) natural dispersal should be the goal of future studies on this seldom-conceived biogeographic relationship. Isolated species endemic to islands on the outer periphery of biogeographic and political regions represent particular conservation challenges. This is especially true if a species occurs on an isolated island that is allied biogeographically with one nation, but politically administered by another. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {We describe a new species of Boophis treefrog from Ranomafana National Park in the southern central east of Madagascar. This region has remarkably high anuran diversity, and along with neighbouring sites, hosts more than 35 Boophis species. Boophis boppa sp. nov. is part of the B. ankaratra sub-clade (herein named the B. ankaratra complex), previously identified within the monophyletic B. albipunctatus species group. It occurs sympatrically with two other species of the complex (B. ankaratra and B. schuboeae). Morphological differentiation of species within the B. ankaratra clade remains elusive, but species are well characterized by distinct advertisement calls, with B. boppa having the longest note duration and inter-note intervals when compared to closely related species. Furthermore, it has moderate differentiation in mitochondrial DNA, with pairwise distances of 1.9-3.7{\%} to all other species in sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA marker. Additional evidence is given by the lack of haplotype sharing with related species for the nuclear exon DNAH-3. All examples of syntopic occurrence in this complex involve species with strongly different advertisement calls, while allopatric species have more similar calls. Such a pattern might result from adaptive call co-evolution but could also be the result of non-adaptive processes. Thorough clarification of the systematics of the B. ankaratra sub-clade is required, and we outline future directions for both bioacoustic and genetic research.},

abstract = {We summarize all available amphibian and reptile species distribution data from the northeast Mindanao faunal region, including small islands associated with this subcenter of endemic vertebrate biodiversity. Together with all publicly available historical information from biodiversity repositories, we present new data from several major herpetological surveys, including recently conducted inventories on four major mountains of northeast Mindanao, and adjacent islands of Camiguin Sur, Dinagat, and Siargao. We present species accounts for all taxa, comment on unresolved taxonomic problems, and provide revisions to outdated IUCN conservation status assessments in cases where our new data significantly alter earlier classification status summaries. Together, our comprehensive analysis of this fauna suggests that the greater Mindanao faunal region possesses distinct subcenters of amphibian and reptile species diversity, and that until this area is revisited and its fauna and actually studied, with on-the-ground field work including targeted surveys of species distributions coupled to the study their natural history, our understanding of the diversity and conservation status of southern Philippine herpetological fauna will remain incomplete. Nevertheless, the northeast Mindanao geographical area (Caraga Region) appears to have the highest herpetological species diversity (at least 126 species) of any comparably-sized Philippine faunal subregion.},

@article{Protzel2018,
abstract = {On a recent expedition to eastern Madagascar, we discovered a distinct new species of the genus Calumma that we describe here using an integrative approach combining morphology, coloration, osteology and molecular genetics. Calumma roaloko sp. n. has a dermal rostral appendage and occipital lobes, and belongs to the C. boettgeri complex, within the Madagascar-endemic phenetic C. nasutum species group. It is readily distinguished from other species of the C. boettgeri complex by a characteristic two-toned body coloration and small body size with a snout-vent length of 45.6 mm in an adult male. The osteology of the skull, with a prominent maxilla and broad parietal, is similar to the closest related species, C. uetzi. Analysis of uncorrected genetic distances within the C. nasutum group using the mitochondrial gene ND2 shows a minimum pairwise distance of 11.98{\%} to C. uetzi from the Sorata massif and Marojejy National Park {\textgreater} 500 km north of the type locality of C. roaloko sp. n.. Given an apparently small range (potentially {\textless} 300 km 2 ), located entirely outside of any nationally-protected areas, we recommend this new species be classified as Endangered under criterion B1ab(iii) of the IUCN Red List. The discovery of clearly distinct species like C. roaloko sp. n. in an area of Madagascar that is comparatively thoroughly surveyed highlights the critical role of continued field surveys for understanding the true extent of Madagascar's spectacular biodiversity.},

@article{Oaks2019,
abstract = {Many biotic and abiotic factors that inﬂuence the distribution, abundance, and diversiﬁcation of species can simultaneously aﬀect multiple evolutionary lineages within or across communities. These include environmental changes and inter-speciﬁc ecological interactions that cause ranges of multiple, co-distributed species to contract, expand, or become fragmented. Such processes predict temporally clustered patterns of evolutionary events across species, such as synchronous population divergences and/or changes in population size. This has generated interest in developing statistical methods that infer such patterns from genetic data. There have been a number of methods developed to infer shared divergences or changes in eﬀective population size, but not both, and the latter has been limited to approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We introduce a general, full-likelihood Bayesian method that can estimate temporal clustering of an arbitrary mix of population divergences and population-size changes across taxa. We use this method to assess how well we can infer temporal patterns of shared population-size changes compared to divergences when using all the information in genomic data. We ﬁnd that estimating the timing and sharing of demographic changes is much more challenging than divergences. Even under favorable simulation conditions, the ability to infer shared demographic events is quite limited and very sensitive to prior assumptions, which is in sharp contrast to accurate, precise, and robust estimates of shared divergence times. Our results also suggest that previous estimates of co-expansion among ﬁve Alaskan populations of threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were likely spurious, and driven by a combination of mispeciﬁed prior assumptions and the lack of information about the timing of demographic changes when invariant charcters are ignored. We conclude by discussing potential avenues to improve the estimation of synchronous demographic changes across populations.},

abstract = {By providing a framework of accounting for the shared ancestry inherent to all life, phylogenetics is becoming the statistical foundation of biology. The importance of model choice continues to grow as phylogenetic models continue to increase in complexity to better capture micro- and macroevolutionary processes. In a Bayesian framework, the marginal likelihood is how data update our prior beliefs about models, which gives us an intuitive measure of comparing model fit that is grounded in probability theory. Given the rapid increase in the number and complexity of phylogenetic models, methods for approximating marginal likelihoods are increasingly important. Here, we try to provide an intuitive description of marginal likelihoods and why they are important in Bayesian model testing. We also categorize and review methods for estimating marginal likelihoods of phylogenetic models, highlighting several recent methods that provide well-behaved estimates. Furthermore, we review some empirical studies that demonstrate how marginal likelihoods can be used to learn about models of evolution from biological data. We discuss promising alternatives that can complement marginal likelihoods for Bayesian model choice, including posterior-predictive methods. Using simulations, we find one alternative method based on approximate-Bayesian computation to be biased. We conclude by discussing the challenges of Bayesian model choice and future directions that promise to improve the approximation of marginal likelihoods and Bayesian phylogenetics as a whole.},

@article{Hutter2019,
abstract = {Despite the increasing use of high-throughput sequencing in phylogenetics, many phylogenetic relationships remain difficult to resolve because of conflict between gene trees and species trees. Selection of different types of markers (i.e. protein-coding exons, non-coding introns, ultra-conserved elements) is becoming important to alleviate these phylogenomic challenges. For evolutionary studies in frogs, we introduce the new publicly available FrogCap suite of genomic resources, which is a large and flexible collection of probes corresponding to ∼15,000 markers that unifies previous frog sequencing work. FrogCap is designed to be modular, such that subsets of markers can be selected based on the phylogenetic scale of the intended study. FrogCap uses a variety of molecular marker types that include newly obtained exons and introns, previously sequenced UCEs, and Sanger-sequencing markers, which span a range of alignment lengths (100–12,000 base pairs). We tested three probe sets from FrogCap using 105 samples across five phylogenetic scales, comparing probes designed using a consensus- or genome-based approach. We also tested the effects of using different bait kit sizes on depth of coverage and missing data. We found that larger bait kits did not result in lowered depth of coverage or increased missing data. We also found that sensitivity, specificity, and missing data are not related to genetic distance in the consensus-based probe design, suggesting that this approach has greater success and overcomes a major hurdle in probe design. We observed sequence capture success (in terms of missing data, quantity of sequence data, recovered marker length, and number of informative sites) and compared them at all phylogenetic scales. The incorporation of different molecular marker types allowed recovery of the variation required for resolving difficult phylogenetic relationships and for performing population genetic studies. Altogether, FrogCap is a valuable and adaptable resource for performing high-throughput sequencing projects across variable timescales.},
